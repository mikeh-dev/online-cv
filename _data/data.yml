    info:
      - details: |
          Worked on projects with HTML,CSS and Wordpress since I was a teenager and more recently Webflow. 
          
          Began a more software focused learning path at the end of 2019 with Ruby thanks to the mentorship of a close friend who is a Ruby on Rails veteran.

          Early learning was with various online platforms inc CS50, Codecademy, Treehouse, Launch School, Udemy with some exposure to C++ and Javascript.

          Moved forward with Ruby on Rails and spent the last couple of years building SaaS applications which I felt where small enough to manage but big enough to learn and challenge myself.

            - Learned basics of deployment on Heroku, Digital Ocean and AWS
            - Developed skills in Hotwire, Tailwind, API's and TDD Development.
            - Launched www.kartsteam.co.uk in early 2024 and improved and maintained the application ever since.
