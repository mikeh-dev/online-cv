          **Early Development Exposure:**

          Built websites using HTML, CSS, and WordPress.

          Experimented with Webflow for creating modern web experiences.

          **Focused Learning Path (2019 Onwards):**

          Began structured software development learning with Ruby, mentored by a Ruby on Rails veteran.

          Engaged with various learning platforms like CS50, Codecademy, Treehouse, Launch School, and Udemy, gaining exposure to C++, JavaScript, and other technologies.

          **Advancing with Ruby on Rails (2021-Present):**

          Built and iterated on multiple SaaS applications, managing projects independently and ensuring they were challenging enough to grow my skill set.

          Deployed applications on platforms such as Heroku, DigitalOcean, and AWS.

          Developed proficiency in Hotwire, Tailwind CSS, API development, and TDD with RSpec.
          
          Implemented CI/CD practices and utilized external APIs for maps, weather, and other location-based information in KartStream.
          
          Launched and maintained KartStream (2024), focusing on performance optimization, UI enhancement, and code quality improvements.

          Full Stack Rails Developer
          2024 - Present | KartStream

          **Problem:**
          Karting clubs needed a platform to manage their events, tracks, and member engagement efficiently. Drivers, parents, and mechanics also required an online reference to access track and event information easily and conveniently, ensuring they had real-time updates and accurate details.

          **Requirement:**
          The solution had to be a user-friendly, scalable application that enhanced the user interface, optimized performance, and integrated with external services like maps and weather for location-specific features. It also needed to allow data sharing with other applications via APIs.

          **Solution:**
          Developed and maintain a full-stack Ruby on Rails application that meets these requirements, focusing on performance optimization and UI enhancement through iterative code refinement.

          Tech Stack: Ruby on Rails, Hotwire, Postgres, Tailwind CSS, RSpec (TDD), CI/CD pipelines, and external APIs for location and weather services.

          Built and exposed APIs to share data with external services, demonstrating the application’s capability to integrate and provide valuable information beyond its own platform.
